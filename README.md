Fixed Width on Android Cordova


The meta viewport on cordova android does not handle fixed widths properly.  Main problems being unwanted zoom in's on double clicks and on input text box clicks.  This code has been tested and works on a HTC G2 2.3.4, Samsung GS2 4.0.4, Samsung GS3 4.3 and Genymotion 4.1.1, 4.2.2, and 4.4.2.
